CIA - Confidentiality , availability and integrity. 
Non repudiation- Not refusing to recognize the validity of something. 
DAD-Disclosure of data, alteration of data and destruction/denial of data. 
Security Models : Bell-LaPadula Model(write up read down), The Biba Integrity Model( read up write down) , The Clark-Wilson Model.
Trust but verify : This requires automated security mechanisms, such as proxy, intrusion detection, and intrusion prevention systems.
Zero trust - authenticationn and authorization. 
ISO/ICE 19249 - Domain separation, Layering , encapsulation , redudancy and virtualization. Design principles : least privilige , attack surface minimization, centralized parameter validation, centralized general security services, preparation for error and exception handling. 
IAAA- identification, authentication, authorization and accountibility are the 4 pillars of Information Security.
**Identification** : Username, email address , unique ID number etc
**Authenticationn** : prove their Identity. Example : entering right password. 
**Authorisation** : determines what the user is allowed to access. 
**Accountability** : tracks user activity to ensure they are responsible for their actions. 
**Logging** : process of recording events that occur within a system. It is good to have separate logging server with one task - log forwarding. 
**Log Forwarding** : Process of sending log information from one system to another. This process often aggregates log data from multiple sources into a central location for more accessible analysis and management. Log forwarding can also be used to send log data to a cloud-based service for storage and analysis.
**SIEM (Security Information and event management)** : a technology that aggregates log data from multiple sources and analyses it for signs of security threats. Helps identify anomalies, detect potential security incidents, and provide alerts to security teams. By integrating logging and SIEM, organisations can better understand their system and network activity and oversee potential threats. 
Compliance reporting is the process of documenting and communicating an organization's adherence to regulatory standards, policies, and legal requirements. 
**IDM ( Identity management)** : It make sure authorized people have access and deny unauthorized access.  It involves the management of user identities, their authentication, authorisation, and access control. 
**IAM ( Identity and access management )** :  IAM systems include a variety of functions, such as user provisioning, access control, identity governance, and compliance management. IAM systems ensure that only authorised users have access to specific resources and data and that their access is monitored and controlled.. IAM systems use various technologies to manage access, including role-based access control, multi-factor authentication, and single sign-on.IAM systems help organisations comply with regulatory requirements such as HIPAA, GDPR, and PCI DSS. 
**System Access Controls** : 1. Discretionary Access Control (DAC) when sharing files or folders with friends and colleagues. When using DAC, the resource owner will explicitly add users with the proper permissions. 2. Role Based access control : Granting access based on roles. 3. An operating system using Mandatory Access Control (MAC) would prioritise security and significantly limit users’ abilities.
