Microsoft thinks about Identity while designing products and solutions. - **Zero Trust** : 1. Verify 2. Give only enough access to do their job 3. Assume breach. 
**Verify Explicitly**Always validate all available data points including:User identity and location,Anomalies, Data classification, Device Health, Service or workload context. 
**Use least privilege access** :To help secure both data and productivity, limit user access using: Just-in-time (JIT), Just enough access (JEA) , Risk-based adaptive policies, Data classification	Data protection against out of band vectors	. 
**Assume breach** : Minimize blast radius for breaches and prevent lateral movement by:Segmenting access by network, user, devices, and app awareness, Encrypting all sessions end to end, Use analytics for threat detection, posture visibility and improving defenses. 
Zero trust should be implemented on six elements- Identity, endpoint , data , applications, infrastructure and network. 
Identity and access management and endpoint-management solutions enables your organization to verify users and devices explicitly. Verification is done with rich signal, such as device health and sign-in risk.
Information protection and cloud security solutions help enforce decisions and protect resources across the entire environment in real time. Networking solutions help use real-time threat protection to detect and respond to threats across your networks and infrastructure.
Finally, the integrated security information and event management (SIEM) and extended detection and response (XDR) solutions to deliver true, end-to-end threat prevention, detection, and response.
Identity as the control panel for accessing resources.
